Seeds of Change is a tool aimed a characterizing patterns of environmental variation across space and time within the ranges of California plant species, helping to identify potential matches between collection and planting sites for ecological restoration projects in California, incorporating data on species ranges, soil variation, and future climate change. The project originated as a collaboration between resource managers at the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and a group of researchers at UC Berkeley.

This is a beta version of the application, and is still under active development. Documentation is incomplete, the tool has not been thoroughly tested, and bugs are possible. Please contact mattkling@berkeley.edu with questions or bug reports.

Links to technical documentation and publications will be added here as they become available.
