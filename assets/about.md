Seeds of Change is a free, open-source tool designed to help support decisions about seed collection and planting for ecological restoration projects in California. It was developed by researchers at UC Berkeley, in collaboration with resource managers at the US National Park Service and the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, with funding from the Berkeley Institute for Parks, People, and Biodiversity.

Links to technical documentation and publications will be added here as they become available.

This tool is provided for informational purposes only, and may not be predictive of plant performance. Users assume all responsibility for any decisions made based on the data provided through this website.
