Seeds of Change is a free, open-source tool designed to help support decisions about seed collection and planting for ecological restoration projects in California. It was developed by [Matthew Kling](http://matthewkling.net/) and collaborators at UC Berkeley, in consultation with resource managers at the US National Park Service and the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, with plant species occurrence data from the [UC Berkeley University and Jepson Herbaria](https://ucjeps.berkeley.edu) and the [Consortium of California Herbaria](https://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/consortium/), funding from the [UC Berkeley Institute for Parks, People, and Biodiversity](https://parks.berkeley.edu), and web hosting by the [UC Berkeley Natural History Museums](https://bnhm.berkeley.edu).

Details on methods and data sources are available in the [technical documentation](seeds-of-change-technical-documentation.pdf).

Source code is available at the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/matthewkling/seeds-of-change). Please report bugs by filing a GitHub issue, or by emailing [mattkling\@berkeley.edu](mailto:mattkling@berkeley.edu).
