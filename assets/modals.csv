i_species,Species,"This application includes all 5211 native vascular plant species known in California. In the box, begin typing the species scientific name and the list will narrow with each letter typed. Select a species to load its estimated California geographic range, which is modeled based on climate, distance to known observations, and landscape intactness. This distribution is used to estimate the species' environmental tolerance, model potential gene flow among nearby populations, and hypothesize which populations may be adapted to the environment of the selected focal site. <br><br>Alernatively, for a generic species-agnostic analysis of environmental similarity between all sites in California, select 'NONE' in the species box."
i_radius,Smoothing radius (km),"A source population's suitability as a genetic match for a planting site with the same environment depends in part on the population's historic balance between selection and gene flow. The relative importance of gene swamping versus local adaptation is known to vary among species. This parameter lets you set the size of the local neighborhood around each source population within which gene flow is expected to homogenize local adaptation. Choose a small smoothing radius to model highly localized adaptation, or a large radius to model strong effects of widespread gene flow relative to local selection."
i_time,Time period,"This tool estimates how well the historic adaptive environment at each provenance site matches the projected future environment at the planting site if site activity is set to 'planting,' or the inverse if site activity is set to 'seed collection.'  For which future time period would you like to estimate climatic similarity? You can also select the historic period, in which case baseline climate data is used for both the focal site and species range. (Note that soil data does not change across time periods.)"
i_ssp,Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emissions scenarios (Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP)),"The IPCC has defined a range of potential future climate trajectories based on different assumptions about climate change mitigation. Select which of these SSPs you would like to compare to historic climate: <ul>
  <li>SSP1-2.6: effective sustainability policies, very low greenhouse gas emissions, net zero by 2050, global average temperature increase in year 2100 ~1.8 deg. C (range 1.3-2.4 deg. C) above pre-industrial</li>
  <li>SSP3-7.0: regional imbalance, no additional policies, high greenhouse gas emissions, doubling 2020 to 2100, global average temperature increase in year 2100 ~3.6 deg. C (range 2.8-4.6 deg. C) above pre-industrial</li>
  <li>SSP5-8.5: fossil fuel-intensive development, very high greenhouse gas emissions, doubling 2020 to 2050, global average temperature increase in year 2100 ~4.4 deg. C (range 3.3-5.7 deg. C) above pre-industrial</li>
</ul>"
i_weight,Soils versus climate,"By default, soil and climate are given equal weight when calculating similarity to the focal site environment and when computing seed zones. Adjust this slider to incorporate species-specific knowledge about their relative importance in shaping local adaptation, or to explore how the results change based on assumptions about their importance."
i_constrain,Limit results to species range,"By default, results are only shown for sites within the species modeled range. If focal site activity is set to 'seed collection,' this option can be set to 'FALSE' to consider prospective planting sites across all of California. This may be useful if the estimated range map omits areas where you know the species occurs, or as a means to explore where locations outside the current range could become suitable in the future."
i_mode,Target site activity,"Select whether the selected focal location is a 'planting' or 'seed collection' site. If it's a planting site, its environment in the selected 'time period' will be compared to historic smoothed environments across the species range (prospective locations where seeds could be collected to plant in the focal site). If it's a collection site, its historic smoothed environment will be compared to range-wide environments from the selected time period (prospective locations where seeds collected in the focal site could be planted)."
i_download,Download results,Click the download button to export a raster file of the current map. This downloads a GeoTiff file, EPSG:4326 coordinate system, 0.008333 degrees spatial resolution.
i_location,Select a focal location,"To choose a focal site, either click on the map, or enter your 'Lon, Lat' in the box and press RETURN on your keyboard."
i_nclust,Number of zones,"Use this slider to select the number of seed zones to produce. This performs a k-means cluster analysis, grouping sites across the species range into clusters with similar environments. Seed zones are independent of the selected focal site, but the 'focal site activity' setting determines which environmental data are used: if the activity is set to 'planting' then clusters are based on smoothed historic data, while if it is set to 'seed collection' then clusters will be based on environmental data for the selected future scenario. The 'soil versus climate' setting affects the relative weight given to the two categories of variable."
i_arrows,Focal site,"The red arrows indicate projected climate change at the focal site for the selected era and emissions scenario, according to five different global climate models (GCMs). The large red point indicates the focal site's environment for the era listed in red, which is what is compared to other sites across the species range to calculate 'environmental difference'; for future time periods this is the average of the GCMs."
i_threshold,Species distribution model (SDM) threshold,"The species range maps in this tool are based on models that estimate continuous gradients of occurrence likelihood, in which every species has suitability values ranging from 0 to 100 across the state. These are not probabilities; they represent occurrence scores as a percentage of the highest occurrence score for the species anywhere in the state. This tool 'thresholds' these suitability maps, displaying only those areas with a modeled occurrence score higher than the value set by the `SDM threshold` slider. <br><br>Choose a lower value to select a broader range (which will likely include more actual populations, but probably also more places the species doesn't actually exist). Choose a higher value to select a narrower range (which will reduce the inclusion of places the species doesn't actually exist, but may also omit more true populations)."
i_color,Display variable,"Use this menu to select which output variable is displayed in color on the map and plot. 'Environmental difference' and 'Seed zones' are the main results computed in the tool, while the other variables are inputs shown for reference."
i_variable,Environmental difference,"This is a measure of how different a location's environment is from the target site. It is the default output variable, and the only one that is specific to the selected focal site. It is a multidimensional z-score, representing the equivalent of how many one-dimensional standard deviations away from the focal site's environment a location is. The standard deviation is defined based on historic spatial variation across the species range. The greater this value, the more dissimilar a location's environment is from the focal site's environment."
i_variable,Seed zones,This variable visualizes environmental patterns across a species' range by clustering sites with similar climate and soil characteristics into discrete groups or zones within a species range. Use the slider to select the desired number of clusters. Zones are based on spatially smoothed historic values when focal site activity is set to 'planting,' or on non-smoothed future values for the selected time period and emissions scenario when site activity is set to 'collection.'
i_variable,Actual evapotranspiration,"Actual evapotranspiration (AET) is one of the five climate variables used to calculate environmental differences and seed zones.
